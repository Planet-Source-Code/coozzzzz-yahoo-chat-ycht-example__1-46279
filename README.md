## Yahoo\! Chat \(YCHT\) Example


</div>

### Description

Demonstrates usage of the YCHT Protocol which is encapsulated (along with winsock) within a class module. All parsing of incoming packets and handling of outgoing packets are handled within the module itself and EventRaise's to return the data to a form which created an instance of it.
 
### More Info
 
This is by-far complete and may have incorrect parsing of some packets (such as multiple friend status packets) due to lack of testing.

Before running the project make sure you've changed the "Username" and "Password" within the Form_Load Sub. Once connected you may test some commands from the TextBox at the bottom.

Examples:

/join The Bored Room:1

/goto Coozzzzz

/pm Coozzzzz Hello!

The GUI of the form is not good and is not meant to be. It's meant to demonstrate the uses of the class module and events raised by it.
